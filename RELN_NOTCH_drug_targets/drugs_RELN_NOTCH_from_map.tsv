XL784 was specifically optimized to be MMP-1 sparing, thus potentially enhancing its safety profile and enabling higher dosing compared with other previously studied metalloprotease inhibitors. Results of single dose Phase I clinical trials of XL784 administered orally to 96 healthy volunteers have demonstrated that XL784 has attractive safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.
